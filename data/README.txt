Notes:

The file consists of 9 possible actions, all contributing to running a university squash leauge.

The code is all self running and will adapt without maintenance to any of the valid inputs.

When editing the file it will ask you whether you want to save or not. This stops any unwanted changes being saved to
the players file. There is a back up players file which can be used if the original one is modified to get back to the
initial state.

Exception handling on input code stops any bad input and allows default values to be used.

All code is modular and self running for example the code will read the length of the longest name or email in the txt
file and then format the table so that it is of the correct length for that division.

The code managed two lists one a list of players useful for player based operations and another an array of divisions
for division based operations. These lists are kept in step during editing operations.

WARNING: When prompted to save the document only do so when certain as saving the document will overwrite the original
file,a back up copy has been made in the case of a problem and to copy into players.txt to reset the league.
